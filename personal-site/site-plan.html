      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>As a college student on a budget, I wanted to make a website that could provide others with budget friendly, healthy, and time effective meals. A couple meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a bonus dessert.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> My intended audience would include those who are on a budget as well as college students.
         But it ranges to anyone who needs a time effective and healthy meal.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        Grocery List:
Sweet Potato, 
3+  Bananas,
Frozen Mixed Berries,
Frozen Broccoli, 
Spinach,
Lunch Meat (I like ham or Turkey),
Chicken (I use frozen), 
Eggs 18,
Yogurt (Brands: Stony Field, Colonial Supernaturals, Zoi: Honey), 
Shredded Cheese (Fiesta Blend),
Sour Cream (8 ounce container),
Butter Unsalted (I like to buy a few boxes and freeze them),
Granola (Off Brand: French Vanilla),

Semi-Sweet Chocolates Chips,
Can of Pineapple Chunks,
Can of Cream of Chicken Soup,
Chicken Broth (I prefer reduced salt, or unsalted),
(All the necessary baking ingredients in bulk) 
(Other items I have on my grocery list:
Frozen Beef, Apples, Tomato, Avocado, Bell Peppers, Carrots, Soup Items, Pasta, Pasta Sauce) 
Tips:
I like to buy in bulk, on sale, in season, frozen, and generic brands as much as possible. 
Soups are my go to, or something that can last multiple days. I like to make big portions for dinners and then use the leftovers for lunches the next few days. 
To get a variety I buy chicken one week and beef another week, but I rotate back and forth. Same with veggies and fruits. 
It is also about where you shop. For example a Walmart will be cheaper than an Albertsons or Broliums. A Winco would be the best place to shop.
